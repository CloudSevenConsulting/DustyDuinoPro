Making Tests
************

To make a set of tests, 3 files must be modified/created:

- A separate ``.c`` file must be created in ``tester\``
- A corresponding ``.h`` file must be created in ``tester\``
- ``debug.c`` must be modified to include the testing

Ideally, each ``.c`` file should correspond to the testing for one logical
grouping of peripherals/resources/types of tests. However no strict guidelines
are in place and is *ad-hoc*.

Creating the ``.c`` file
========================

The ``.c`` file contains the functions for testing. Each function should be one
distinct test.

The functions must be of ``int`` return type and must return ``1`` if the tests
succeeds or ``0`` if the test fails.

.. note::
   Test outcome handling is not to be done locally in the tests. The tests **must**
   return a boolean to represent the test outcome and shift the handling to
   the caller (``debug.c`` or ``main.c``)

Creating the ``.h`` file
========================

The ``.h`` file is a regular header file with an header include guard


Modifying ``debug.c``
=====================

Three modifications must be made in ``debug.c`` for a new test:

- Create a new macro for testing selection
- Include the ``.h`` file for the test in question (with the necessary conditional build statements)
- Call the testing functions in the ``tester()`` routine, handling the test outcome accordingly (and with the necessary conditional build statements)

Macro for Test Selection
------------------------

The macro for test selection must be defined in ``debug.c`` as follows (for example,
let's say we are testing 'a new thing');

.. code-block:: c

   /* ****************************************************************************
    * Test Selection
    * ***************************************************************************/
   #define TEST_SMB_ENABLE 1
   #define TEST_MEMORY_ENABLE 0

   /* ... */

   #define TEST_NEWTHING_ENABLE 1    /*<-- our new macro*/

Include Testing Header
----------------------

The header must be included in ``debug.c`` **if the corresponding macro is set to 1**.
This is done in the ``Test Headers`` section of the source code as follows (for example,
let's say our header was ``test_newthing.h``)

.. code-block:: c

   /* ****************************************************************************
    * Test Headers
    * ***************************************************************************/
   #if TEST_SMB_ENABLE
   #include "test_smb.h"
   #endif

   /* ... */

   #if TEST_NEWTHING_ENABLE         /*<-- our new test*/
   #include "test_newthing.h"
   #endif

Calling the Test Functions
--------------------------

Finally, the ``tester()`` routine must call the relevant test functions
from ``test_newthing.c`` (our example).

Note, that the available testing functions for reporting (in this case ``TestFail()``) may
change.

.. code-block:: c

   void tester(void)
   {

   #if TEST_SMB_ENABLE
       ret = test_smb_eeprom_simple_write_read();
       if (ret == 0)
       {
           TestFail();
       }
   #endif/*TEST_SMB*/

   /* ... */

   #if TEST_NEWTHING_ENABLE         /*<-- our new test*/
        ret = test_some_unit_test_for_new_thing();
        if (ret == 0)
        {
            TestFail();
        }
    #endif/*TEST_NEWTHING*/
   }
