Devices
=======

There will be three devices on the network
- Motes (a.k.a Sensor Hosts)
- Access Points (APs)
- Network Managers (NMs)

NMs will have AP code within them because
- They have no computational restraints
- They have no power consumption restraints

and hence they have the luxury of including lots of functionality without compromise
