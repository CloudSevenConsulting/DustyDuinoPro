Building with Atmel Studio 7
****************************

To build with Atmel Studio 7 (AS7), there are 2 steps:

1. :ref:`Make an AVRDUDE tool in AS7 <sec-usage-developing-as7-building-avrdude>`
2. :ref:`Use the tool <sec-usage-developing-as7-building-build>`

.. _sec-usage-developing-as7-building-avrdude:

AVRDUDE tool
============

We will make a new ``External Tool`` in AS7 for building with
``avrdude.exe``

In AS7 go to the ``Tools`` menu and click ``External Tools`` as seen below

A new dialog window should pop up as below.

Fill in the following fields as follows:

1. Name your new tool *Build to DuinoPro* (can be anything)
2. Enter in the path to ``avrdude.exe``. This will be installation dependent, but if you are using Windows and you set everything to default, it should be ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\tools\avr\bin\avrdude.exe``
3. Enter in the following line:

::

    -C "C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\tools\avr\etc\avrdude.conf" -p atmega328p -c arduino -P COM4 -b 115200 -U flash:w:"$(ProjectDir)Debug\$(TargetName).hex":i

4. Check the ``Use Output Window`` box

**Note**:
    - In step 3, the path ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\tools\avr\etc\avrdude.conf`` is also installation dependent
    - In step 3, The ``COM4`` parameter may change, see :ref:`below <sec-usage-developing-as7-building-com>`

Determining your COM Port
-------------------------

For Windows, open ``Device Manager`` (``Ctrl+x``, ``m``).

**With the device connected** you should see a ``Ports (COM & LPT)`` section. Expand
that section, and the device listed will be the COM port you use for your build parameter.

Building with the Tool
======================

Once you have made your AVRDUDE tool, you can use that tool to build with AS7
when your device is connected.
