Going back to an old commit
===========================

Use this ``log`` format to get a quick review of all the commits

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git log --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h %Cred%ad %Cblue%an%Cgreen%d %Creset%s' --date=short

This will output something like this

.. code-block:: bash

    d253315 2017-05-19 Person A Modified timer for TIMER0
    f106360 2017-05-19 Jamie Phan Decouple SMB interrupt from main
    466ce7c 2017-05-19 Jamie Phan Add Design Documentation
    3d2496f 2017-05-19 Jamie Phan Unit test folder

The cryptic looking string of text and numbers that start the line is the commit ``SHA1`` in shortened form

To review that code use;

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout [cryptic-text-number-combo]

For example;

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout 4552c5d

    Note: checking out '4552c5d'.

    You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
    changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
    state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

.. note::
   Note that is says you're in a ``detached HEAD`` state. Do not make any changes right now
   unless you know what you're doing!

To go back do;

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git checkout master
