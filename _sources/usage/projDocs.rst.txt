Project Documentation
*********************

`Project documentation`_ can be found in the ``gh-pages`` branch.

.. _Project Documentation: https://kjph.github.io/c7c-atamo-dusty/

The ``.rst`` files are shipped to ``./sources``

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git checkout gh-pages
   $ cd ./_sources

To contribute to the documentation you must:

1. Install Python and Sphinx
2. Setup your Sphinx project
3. Building


Installing Python Sphinx
========================

Python Sphinx_ is a tool that helps build documentation out of reStructured Text (rst)
marked-up files.

.. _Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/

You must have Python installed (we recommend `Python 3.x <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_).

Once Python is installed, you should have the ``pip`` utility installed natively (if not, `go here <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_). To check if you have ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python -m pip --version
   pip 9.0.1 from C:\...\Python\Python36-32\lib\site-packages (python 3.6)

Once you checked ``pip`` is installed, run the command to install Sphinx:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python -m pip install Sphinx

We will also need the ``sphinx_rtd_theme`` for our docs:

   $ python -m pip install sphinx_rtd_theme

Setup your Sphinx Project
=========================

You will need to setup your sphinx project in a separate directory the git repo:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd ~
   $ mkdir someDir
   $ cd someDir/
   $ sphinx-quickstart.exe

   # press [enter] to all options


Building
========

Because of the way the branch ``gh-pages`` is set-up, a funny build process is required.

.. note::

   Team to consider automating this with Python tool

1. If the indexes must change (i.e. new files added/files moved) then a clean is required before build

    a) **Do not** use ``make clean``, as this will remove the ``.git`` files
    b) Manually remove all build files (everything in ``build/html`` excluding the hidden ``.git`` directory)
    c) Build the ``DOxygen`` ``xml``

2. ``Make`` the files from source with ``make html``
3. ``git add --all``
4. ``git commit -m "docs"`` (who cares about commit messages here)
5. ``git push origin gh-pages``
